# Complex Arithmetic in Extended Memory for HP-41cv/cx

Complex numbers are commonly used to simplify the analysis of linear circuits in electrical and mechanical engineering.  This program makes complex arithmetic as easy as working with normal numbers on HP-41CV and HP-41CX calculators.

Features
* Ease of use
* Displays the whole complex number at once
* 15 mathematical, 12 trigonometric, 12 hyperbolic and 10 stack manipulation functions.
* Supports both rectangular and polar mode
* Stack mechanism identical to the normal stack
* Requires only 5 registers of main memory (assuming extended memory is used).

Files
* `.raw` files can be downloaded in emulators
* `.txt` files are sources for the `Win41uc.exe` compiler (run in Windows/XP sandbox, because 16-bit executable)
* `*_o.png` are overlays for the Android go41cv emulator
* `*.jpg` are overlays to be printed and cut out for a real HP-41
* `*.url` are links to articles describing the software
