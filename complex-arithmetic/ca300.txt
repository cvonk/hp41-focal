; The program consists of two parts.  The part listed below should be
; in main memory.  The other part (listed in CA300xm.txt) can be
; placed in either main or extended memory.  When placed in extended
; memory, THE INSTRUCTION GTO "X" SHOULD BE REMOVED.

; Before placing the second part in XM, the program should be PACKed
; and run in RAM.  This should be done to compile all the GTO's and
; XEQ's.  If this is not done one will see CHKSUM ERR when trying to
; download this program into RAM. [9]
